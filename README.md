<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m @Ajaunte! I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer from Austin, TX.ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤ </h1>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<h4>Web design & website building, and video & photo editing.</h4>

Frontend development and web design as a whole, I've had this interest since I was a kid and have spent hours upon hours experimenting and making mock websites as well as designing a few personal and business websites using drag and drop editors.

<h4>Video & photo editing</h4>
Along with website building, I am a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ajaunte_/videos" target="_blank">video editor</a> with over 9 years of experience in Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Mocha AE, and Davinci Resolve. Circa 2015-2019 were my most active years of gaining experience in video editing. During this time, I made it my priority to learn Adobe After Effects on my own. As my practice material, I often edited music videos using various random video sources as if it were the original that the music came from. This was extremely educational and helped develop my eye for editing.

<h2> Software Experience</h2>

  <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
  <li>Wix online editor</li>
  <li>Adobe XD</li>
